This is the repository for your final class project. 

By 11:59 pm on Monday the 13th create your own (groups are fine, then the branch name will have multiple names) branch with:

	Very short description of the project
	What type of data you will be using and where it comes from and how you will get it
	What you will attempt to get out of the data
